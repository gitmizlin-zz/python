<h2>1. List basics</h2>


<h3>Exercise 1.1</h3>

<p>Concatenate the two lists [ozelot, Berenger] and [lion, desk]. Answer with your list. 
</p>






<h3>Exercise 1.2</h3>

<p>Use the list [Dafoe, Sheen, Berenger, Depp, Whitaker]. Add the words: 'purple' and 'pirate' as the second and third element. Answer with the modified list.

</p>






<h3>Exercise 1.4</h3>

<p>Sort the list [wasp, fly, butterfly, bumblebee, mosquito] in ascending alphabetical order. Answer with the sorted list.
</p>






<h3>Exercise 1.5</h3>

<p>Use the list from the last excercise ([wasp, fly, butterfly, bumblebee, mosquito]) and sort it in decending alphabetical order. Answer with the sorted list.
</p>






<h3>Exercise 1.6</h3>

<p>Use pop() to get the second and the last element in the list: [Dafoe, Sheen, Berenger, Depp, Whitaker]. Answer with the popped elements in a new list.
</p>






<h3>Exercise 1.7</h3>

<p>Use remove() to delete the word: 'bumblebee' from the list: [wasp, fly, butterfly, bumblebee, mosquito]. Answer with the modified list.
</p>







<h2>2. Built-in list functions</h2>

<p>Some basic built-in functions
</p>


<h3>Exercise 2.1</h3>

<p>Use a built-in function to sum all numbers in the list: [567, 23, 12, 36, 7]. Answer with the result as an integer.
</p>






<h3>Exercise 2.2</h3>

<p>Use built-in functions, such as 'sum' and 'len' to get the average value of the list: [45, 22, 2, 498, 78]. Answer with the result as a float with at most one decimal.
</p>






<h3>Exercise 2.3</h3>

<p>Use a built-in function to get the lowest number in the list: [45, 22, 2, 498, 78]. Answer with the result as a integer.
</p>






<h3>Exercise 2.4</h3>

<p>Use the built-in functions split() and join() to fix this string: 'The?wind?is?blowing' into a real sentence, (without '?'). Answer with the fixed string.
</p>






<h3>Exercise 2.5</h3>

<p>Use the string: 'Whenever I feel the need to exercise, I lie down until it goes away.' and split it with the delimiter ' ' (space). Answer with the element at index 10.
</p>






<h3>Exercise 2.6</h3>

<p>Use slice on the list [dvd, mp3, blu-ray, vhs, cd] and replace the second and third element with 'green, purple'. Answer with the modified list.
</p>






<h3>Exercise 2.7</h3>

<p>Use slice on the list [dvd, mp3, blu-ray, vhs, cd] and replace the last two elements with 'green, purple'. Answer with the modified list.
</p>






<h3>Exercise 2.8</h3>

<p>Use slice on the list [dvd, mp3, blu-ray, vhs, cd] and insert the words 'green, purple' after the third element. Answer with the modified list.
</p>






<h3>Exercise 2.9</h3>

<p>Use 'del' on the list [tree, stone, grass, water, sky] and delete the first element. Answer with the modified list.
</p>






<h3>Exercise 2.10</h3>

<p>Use 'del' on the list [tree, stone, grass, water, sky] and delete the second and third element. Answer with the modified list.
</p>






<h3>Exercise 2.11</h3>

<p>Assign the list [a, b, c, d, e] to a variable called 'list1'. Assign the list again, but to another variable called 'list2'. Answer with the result of 'list1 is list2'. 
</p>






<h3>Exercise 2.12</h3>

<p>Use your lists from the last exercise. Assign 'list1' to another variable called 'list3' like this: list3 = list1. Answer with the result of 'list1 is list3'.
</p>






<h3>Exercise 2.13</h3>

<p>Use your lists from the last exercise. Change the first element in 'list1' to 'z'. Answer with 'list3'.
</p>







<h2>3. Lists as arguments</h2>

<p>Some excercises with passing lists as arguments to a function.
</p>


<h3>Exercise 3.1</h3>

<p>Create a function that returns the list passed as argument sorted in numerical and ascending order. Also multiply all values with 10. Use the list: [45, 22, 2, 498, 78], and the built-in method 'sort()'. Answer with the sorted list.
</p>






<h3>Exercise 3.2</h3>

<p>Create a function that takes the list: [45, 22, 2, 498, 78] as argument. The function should multiply all even numbers by 2 and add 7 to all odd numbers. Answer with the modified list sorted in numerical order, descending.
